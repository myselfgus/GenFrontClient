# ZEO - AI Clinical Assistant

Modern, extensible MCP client for clinical transcription and AI assistance with Tesla/xAI inspired interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Audio Recording & Upload**: Native browser recording or file upload support
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based progress updates with smooth animations
- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism design with GSAP animations and Inter typography
- **MCP Architecture**: Built for future integration with Model Context Protocol servers
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Frontend**: Single-page app with three main states:
- Upload (recording/file selection)
- Processing (real-time progress)  
- Results (transcription display)

**Backend**: Express.js server with:
- Audio upload handling via multer
- WebSocket server (port 8080) for real-time updates
- Job tracking system for processing state
- Mock transcription (ready for MCP server integration)

## 🎨 Design System

- **Typography**: Inter font with advanced OpenType features
- **Icons**: Lucide icon system with crisp vectors
- **Effects**: Advanced glassmorphism with backdrop-filter
- **Animations**: GSAP-powered smooth transitions
- **Colors**: Gradient-based palette inspired by Tesla/xAI

## 🔧 Future Integration

The current mock transcription system (`simulateTranscription()` in `server.js`) is designed to be easily replaced with actual MCP server communication. The WebSocket infrastructure and job tracking are already in place to support real transcription services.
